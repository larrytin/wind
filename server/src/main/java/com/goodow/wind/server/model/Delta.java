/**
 * Represents a change in the mutation history of an object.
 * 
 * @param <T> payload type. Parametrised so the server can use String and the client can treat it as
 *          a reified JSON object. Ideally both client and server would use the same type.
 * 
 *          TODO: Two things need to happen first. 1) A JsoView-like interface needs to be created,
 *          with single-jso-impl client implementation, and org.json-backed server implementation.
 *          2) PST needs to be fixed to generate less stupid proto implementations, in fact, just
 *          one simple implementation backed by a shared json interface such as mentioned in 1. Then
 *          "T" would always be that interface (the server could abolish its use of String, because
 *          the json interface would be directly adaptable to a protobuf).
