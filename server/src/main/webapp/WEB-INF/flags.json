/* Affinity only lasts for short periods, after which the object will likely
   move, making the cache counter-productive.  However, it is possible that the
   object will be re-assigned to the same instance (especially with very small
   installations that might only have one instance), so we use a long timeout by
   default.

   When >1 backends are in use, a much smaller value (around
   AFFINITY_MAX_EXPIRATION_SECONDS + .5 * AFFINITY_MIN_EXPIRATION_SECONDS) is
   probably better, but I haven't analyzed this. */
